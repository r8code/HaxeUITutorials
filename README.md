# HaxeUI 2 Tutorials
This repository is dedicated to providing written tutorials for the new version of Haxe UI.

Throughout this tutorial, I will be focusing on the OpenFL backend, but the HaxeUI Core module is very abstract and makes it simple and easy to use the same codebase for any backend.

**Please note that the HaxeUI project is in Alpha, and many things may not work properly or may change over time.**
